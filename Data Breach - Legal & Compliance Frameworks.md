Data Breach - Legal & Compliance Frameworks
Context
In this case study, I'm given the situation of a financial services company that has suffered a very serious cyberattack, compromising the personal and financial data of its clients through ransomware that allows access to information and fraudulent transactions. I'm immediately asked to analyze this case from the international cybersecurity legal framework. This case study has great real-world value, as such a situation could not only occur, but would have very serious consequences for the company and its clients. Knowing how to react in accordance with legal frameworks is a fundamental skill for any security professional.

Furthermore, a financial services company is highly susceptible to cyberattack attempts due to the type of information it stores and manages, as this can provide an opportunity to sell it or conduct fraudulent transactions (as we will now analyze).

This financial institution has been infiltrated by ransomware, which is malicious software that blocks access to its victim's systems or data and demands a ransom to regain access. Typically, if the victim doesn't pay the ransom, cybercriminals delete the data or share it with others or the public.

International Legal Framework
Cyberspace, being a space where users communicate and interact, either among themselves or with a service provider, presents risks and threats to those who use it. Therefore, there was a need to create a set of rules, laws, regulations, and usage guidelines aimed at guaranteeing and protecting users' digital rights, as well as attempting to mitigate risks and reduce the possibility of threats. Cybersecurity seeks to protect information and systems. But if each institution, company, or organization is allowed to implement the security measures they desire, how do users know their data and rights are protected? Well, that's why, throughout (recent) history, agreements, laws, and regulations have been agreed upon with the aim of establishing international standards and obligations.

As this institution operates in several European Union countries, it is subject to the international legal framework used in the EU. The EU has an international cybersecurity strategy for all countries to follow, which establishes minimum standard requirements for capacity building and planning, information sharing, cooperation, and security requirements for operators of essential services and digital service providers.

Some of the most important initiatives in the US, at the level of international cybersecurity legal frameworks, and relevant to our case are:
The Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, signed in 2001, aims to enumerate and delimit computer crimes (in this case, ransomware is classified as a crime); promote the harmonization of laws at the international level; foster international commitment to cooperation in cases of cybercrime; create national contact authorities for responding to cyber incidents; and strengthen the need to guarantee human rights in cyberspace.
ENISA, the European Network and Information Security Agency, was established in 2004. It is dedicated to achieving a high, common level of cybersecurity across Europe and exploring future threats.
Implementation of the NIS and NIS2 directives, the Network and Information Security Directive, which are legislations aimed at improving the level of cybersecurity, especially for essential service operators and digital service providers.
Establishment of the European Union Cybersecurity Strategy in 2013, which accompanies the proposed NIS Directive and aims to clarify the principles that should guide cybersecurity policy in the EU and internationally.
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Parliament, in 2016, on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data.

Given the cyberattack described above, the financial institution, as it operates internationally within the EU, must follow several legal and regulatory requirements established by the Budapest Convention, the NIS and NIS2 Directives, and the GDPR. First, the institution should immediately activate its incident response plan, which should include steps to contain the ransomware, mitigate the damage, and investigate the breach (assuming the company already had one in place, as it should).

Next, you will need to notify the authorities, customers, and affected parties of the data breach. Since the incident resulted in a serious risk and consequences for users' rights and freedoms, the GDPR states that the institution must notify within 72 hours and include: the nature of the breach; categories and approximate number of individuals and records affected; contact details of the Data Protection Officer or relevant point of contact for further information; likely consequences of the breach; and measures taken or proposed to address the breach and mitigate its effects. According to theNIS and NIS2 Directives, the institution must report the incident to the Computer Security Incident Response Team or the appropriate competent authority. The report should include: impact and scope of the incident; technical details and cause of the incident; actions taken to address the incident; and any information that may help prevent further incidents.

Furthermore, according to the Budapest Convention, the institution must cooperate with international law enforcement agencies, sharing all information necessary for the investigation and prosecution of cybercriminals. Communication and cooperation with customers and other affected parties are also important, so it is good practice to proactively communicate with customers about the breach, informing them of steps they can take to protect themselves, such as changing passwords, monitoring account activity, and being cautious of phishing attempts. Also, don't forget fraudulent transactions, which can have significant consequences for those affected. Thus, the organization must address any fraudulent transactions promptly, ensuring that affected customers are compensated and that measures are implemented to prevent further fraudulent activity.

To prevent future cyber attacks, Ensuring improved security measures must be an institution's priority. This may involve patching vulnerabilities, updating security protocols, and conducting a thorough security audit, but also implementing cybersecurity training and education measures for employees. Technological resources are very important, and often the priority is to protect them, but we cannot forget human resources, employees, and users, who play a vital role in protecting information.

Finally, the institution must maintain detailed records of the attack, including the investigation process, communications with authorities and customers, and the steps taken to remedy the problem. This documentation is essential for compliance and potential legal proceedings.

Conclusion
A financial services institution is highly susceptible to cyberattacks, so it must be fully aware of the steps to take in the event of one, and what obligations apply under the applicable international legal framework.

In summary, the institution must take into account the Budapest Convention, the GDPR, the NIS and NIS2 directives, and proceed as follows:
Respond immediately and investigate the attack.
Notify the relevant authorities within the required timeframes.
Inform affected individuals if there is a high risk to their rights and freedoms.
Cooperate with law enforcement authorities.
Communicate transparently with customers and provide support.
Improve security measures to prevent future incidents.
Maintain comprehensive documentation of the attack and response actions.

Compliance with the legal framework and cooperation are both legal and ethical obligations. International initiatives seek not only to enforce the law but also to improve information security for all users of cyberspace. Therefore, organizations that have suffered attacks should feel an ethical responsibility to collaborate with international cybersecurity actors, thereby helping to prevent future attacks on other organizations.
